Purpose:
- Contains custom React hooks for reusable logic.

Usage:
- Use this folder for encapsulating logic like data fetching, authentication, or subscriptions.

Rules:
1. Hooks must be named with the `use` prefix (e.g., `useAuth`, `useFetch`).
2. Ensure hooks are pure and reusable across components.

Example:
useAuth.js
useFetch.js
