Purpose:
- Contains general-purpose utility functions used across the app.

Usage:
- Use this folder for non-component-specific logic, like formatting or API clients.

Rules:
1. Functions must be small and focused on one task.
2. Do not include app-specific logic here.

Example:
dateFormatter.js
apiClient.js
