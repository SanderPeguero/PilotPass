Purpose:
- Holds page-level components or "smart" components that handle state, fetch data, and compose smaller reusable components.

Usage:
- Use this folder for components that correspond to routes or app sections (e.g., Home, Dashboard).

Rules:
1. Each page-level component must have its own folder, named in PascalCase.
2. Include:
   - A `Component.jsx` file for logic.
   - A `Component.module.css` file for styles (if applicable).
   - A `Component.test.js` file for unit tests.
3. Delegate reusable logic or state management to `features/` or `hooks/`.

Example:
Home/
├── Home.jsx
├── Home.module.css
└── Home.test.js
