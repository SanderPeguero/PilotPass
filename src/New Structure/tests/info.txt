Purpose:
- Contains integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests for the application.

Usage:
- Use this folder for tests that span across multiple components or validate full application flows.

Rules:
1. Use tools like Jest for integration tests and Cypress for E2E tests.
2. Structure tests logically by feature or app section.
3. Test file names should clearly indicate the feature or flow being tested.

Example:
auth.test.js
dashboardFlow.test.js
