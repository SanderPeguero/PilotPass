Purpose:
- Contains reusable UI components that are small, self-contained, and focused on presentation.

Usage:
- Use this folder for components like buttons, modals, dropdowns, and form elements.
- Components here should not manage state or have side effects but rely on props for data.

Rules:
1. Each component must have its own folder, named in PascalCase.
2. Include:
   - A `Component.jsx` file for logic.
3. Write clean, reusable, and well-documented code.

Example:
├── Button.jsx
