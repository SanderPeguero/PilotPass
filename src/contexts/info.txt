Purpose:
- Manages shared state using the React Context API.

Usage:
- Use this folder for shared state that doesnâ€™t fit well in `features/` or Redux.

Rules:
1. Ensure state is encapsulated and exposed via context providers.
2. Avoid creating overly large contexts; keep them domain-specific.

Example:
AuthContext.js
ThemeContext.js
