Purpose:
- Holds app-wide configuration files and constants.

Usage:
- Use this folder for environment-specific configurations and constants.

Rules:
1. Avoid hardcoding sensitive data; use `.env` files for secrets.
2. Organize constants logically by domain.

Example:
apiConfig.js
appSettings.js
constants.js
