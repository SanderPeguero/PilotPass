Purpose:
- Contains layout components that define the structure of pages (e.g., headers, sidebars).

Usage:
- Use this folder for reusable layout components like MainLayout or AdminLayout.

Rules:
1. Layouts should focus on structure, not data or state management.
2. Use `props.children` to make layouts reusable.

Example:
MainLayout.jsx
